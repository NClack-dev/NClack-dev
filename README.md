- 👋 Hi, I’m Neil, aka @NClack-dev
- 👀 I’m interested in quite a lot of things, actually. Most notably I've been interested in parallel computing with high cpu core counts, gpus and computer clusters since I was a child, though I've not delved into that yet for some reason... I'm also interested in Data Sciences, Machine learning and Full Stack Web Development with Python, React and similar tools.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Tensorflow, C++, CUDA and MPI
